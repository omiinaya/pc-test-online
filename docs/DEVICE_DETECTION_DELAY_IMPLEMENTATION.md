# Device Detection Delay Implementation

## Summary

Implemented a 2-second delay for showing "No device found" messages in camera and microphone tests.
The delay ensures that device detection errors only appear after 2 seconds of failed detection,
providing a better user experience by avoiding flash of error states during normal device
enumeration.

## Files Changed

### New Files Created

1. **`src/composables/useDeviceDetectionDelay.js`**
   - New composable for managing device detection timing
   - Implements 2-second delay before showing "no devices" messages
   - Provides automatic cleanup and reset functionality
   - Watches device enumeration state and loading status

### Modified Files

2. **`src/composables/useEnhancedDeviceTest.js`**
   - Added import for `useDeviceDetectionDelay`
   - Integrated device detection delay into the enhanced device test pattern
   - Added `showNoDevicesState` computed property
   - Updated `resetTest()` and `cleanup()` methods to reset detection delay
   - Exposed detection delay composable in return object

3. **`src/components/WebcamTest.vue`**
   - Changed from `!hasDevices` to `showNoDevicesState` in template
   - Updated video blur condition to use new state

4. **`src/components/MicrophoneTest.vue`**
   - Changed from `!hasDevices` to `showNoDevicesState` in template
   - Updated canvas overlay condition to use new state

5. **`src/components/SpeakerTest.vue`**
   - Changed from `!hasDevices` to `showNoDevicesState` in template
   - Updated canvas overlay condition to use new state

6. **`src/views/TestsPage.vue`**
   - Updated `currentContainerStyles()` to use consistent 420px height for all tests
   - Improved visual consistency and smoother transitions between test types

## Implementation Details

### How the Delay Works

1. **Detection Start**: When device enumeration begins (`loadingDevices` becomes true), a 2-second
   timer starts
2. **Timer Logic**: After 2 seconds, if no devices are found and enumeration is complete, show the
   "no devices" message
3. **Early Success**: If devices are found before the timer expires, the timer is cancelled and no
   error message is shown
4. **Reset Handling**: When tests are reset, the detection delay state is also reset

### Key Features

- **Non-blocking**: UI remains responsive during the 2-second delay
- **Smart timing**: Only shows errors after enumeration is actually complete
- **Automatic cleanup**: Timers are properly cleared on component unmount
- **Reset integration**: Delay state resets with test state
- **Backwards compatible**: Maintains existing API while adding delay functionality

### Testing

The implementation has been:

- ✅ Built successfully without compilation errors
- ✅ Integrated into existing enhanced device test pattern
- ✅ Applied to all device-based tests (camera, microphone, speaker)
- ✅ Includes proper cleanup and reset functionality

## User Experience Improvement

**Before**: "No camera found" message could flash briefly during normal device enumeration
**After**: Error message only appears after 2 seconds of actual failure, providing smoother UX

## Technical Notes

- Uses Vue 3 composition API with reactive refs and computed properties
- Integrates seamlessly with existing device enumeration logic
- Maintains separation of concerns with dedicated composable
- Follows established patterns from other test composables
- Includes comprehensive error handling and edge case management

## UI Consistency Improvements

### Standardized Container Heights

All visualizer containers now use a consistent height of 420px across all tests for better visual
consistency and smoother transitions between test types.

**Before**: Different tests had varying heights (280px - 420px)  
**After**: All tests use 420px minimum height for uniform appearance
